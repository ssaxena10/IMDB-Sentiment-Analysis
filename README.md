Online Social Network Analysis - CS 579

# Introduction
The goal is to build a text classifier to determine whether a movie review is expressing positive or negative sentiment. The data come from the website IMDB.com.
The data is preprocessed in different ways (creating different features), then the cross-validation accuracy of each approach is compared.
Finally, accuracy on a test set is computed and some analysis of the errors is done.
